## Explanation

Blocitoff is a self-destructing personal checklist application that allows users to create and manage items for a to-do list and was created with the help of a loose framework from the Bloc curriculum. This was my fourth project developed with my mentor for educational purposes during the end of my Rails Web Development track. The project was built using Ruby on Rails Version 5.1.2.
