## Explanation

BlocJams is a personal music player application that allows a user to simply listen to music. They can pick from a list of albums and listen to any song within the album. It was built using AngularJs and Javascript. This project developed for educational purposes during the Frontend Web Development portion of my Software Engineering Track.
