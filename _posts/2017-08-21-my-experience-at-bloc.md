title: My Experience at Bloc
---

Hello and welcome, this is my first blog post for building my portfolio for Bloc. I'm currently in the Full-Time Software Engineering program at Bloc. In this post I am going to be discussing my reasoning for taking this online intensive course. I recently graduated from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas with degrees in Finance and Economics. I enjoyed my time there, and was expecting to work in Finance, but after some thought I decided it wasn't for me and I wanted to try something too. After some inward thinking and soul searching, it finally occurred to me that I was extremely interested in learning how to code! I've always loved computers and all the incredible things people can do with them. So after doing some research online, I found Bloc and I have been very pleased with my choice so far.

I'm currently only 10% through with the program, but I already felt that I have learned a great deal. So far we've mainly dived into Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. With the help of resources such as the Bloc mentors, Bloc online resources, CodeAcademy, Codewars, etc..., I feel I have begun to develop a strong foundation. It has also made me realize how much there is to learn and how many possibilities there actually are when it comes to coding. There is so much information, it makes me feel overwhelmed at times, but I look forward to the challenge of learning as much as possible. My goal is to be a legitimate code/soft-engineer by the end of the program! I look forward to testing myself and seeing how far I can really go.

One skill that I've really enjoyed developing is being able to problem solve and understanding how to use your resources. Coding is so vast, that it is inevitable that you will run into something that you don't know how to do. One thing that Bloc is stressed is having the ability to be able to use your resources and know where to look in order to find the right answer to solve the problem. There have already been numerous times where I was lost, but I was able to going on sites such as StackOverflow.com and figure out what the correct answer is. I think this skill is one of the most valuable I have developed so far.

<b>Here are some of my long term goals!</b>
  * Develop a strong understanding of front-end languages
  * Learn how to use Ruby on Rails
  * Create my own website
  * Develop my own app

Overall, I am happy with my decision to join Bloc and I am looking forward to seeing how far I am going to go in this learning process!



Thanks,

Alex Erling
