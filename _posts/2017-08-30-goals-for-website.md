title: Goals for website
---
I wanted to discuss some of my goals I have in mind for creating my website. I have a few things on my list that I want to include! There are a few different sections that I am interested in making.

Here are some of my ideas:
<ol>
  <li><b> Music - </b></li> I want to have a section dedicated to all of the music that I have been working on, preferably with some links to SoundCloud. I've been improving a significant amount recently and I feel I am very close to start showing my music to the world. Additional to posting music, I was thinking I might begin to post YouTube guides or tutorials on how to produce. My logic is that I could learn a ton from making these tutorials in the first place. Also, it would be great to help others if I could as well.
  <li><b> Photography - </b></li> I would also like to have a place to upload some of my photography. I have some cool photos I have taken on a variety of trips and it would be great to have a website that I made myself to store all of these pictures!
  <li><b> Blog posts - </b></li>  I want to have a section where I can talk about what's on my mind and I can show people my progress whether it be music, coding, photography. I envision this to be the portion of the site where it combines everything I'm doing and shows who I am.
  <li><b> Coding portfolio - </b></li> This portfolio is going to showcase all of the wonderful skills that I am going to learn throughout my time at Bloc. I want to have some great projects in here so I can show everyone that I have developed some useful skills during the program.
  <li><b> Contact page - </b></li>  I want to have a contact page with all my information and links to all of my relevant pages. This will be a resource for all of my other sites as well.
  <li><b> About me - </b></li> This will just be a quick little section that can introduce people to who I am as a person. I think it will be a great starting place to understand why I am going to make my website the way that I am!
</ol>

<p>I have a vision in my head and I'm looking forward to seeing all of my goals come true. I am confident that I will continue posting as I complete all of my goals and make this website a reality.</p>



Thanks for reading,
