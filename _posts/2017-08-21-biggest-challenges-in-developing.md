title: Biggest challenges in developing
---

I wanted to discuss some of the biggest challenges that I have faced in developing so far and what I've done to improve.  


To begin, one of my biggest challenges is staying focused while I am working. I can sometimes get extremely distracted from the projects I am working on by media and other stimuli. One thing I have done is start to make a schedule of when I am supposed to work. During these times I will put my phone on silent and close all tabs that aren't relevant to me. I am efficient when I do work, but it's just about starting to work early and avoiding all the distractions that can get in my way!


Another challenge that I face is in attention to detail. I've realized that for your code to work you need to have everything in it's correct place or the code isn't going to work at all. I consider myself a big thinker and having a strong ability to see the big picture. I sometimes struggle with minor mistakes from paying enough attention to the smaller details. I have done a few things to work on this. First, I've started going through my assignments a little slower, focusing on every individual part a little more. Also, when I have bigger projects to do that require more code, I have started to write out my answer in pseudo-code first. This allows me to get everything in the correct place, then I can covert the pseudo-code into actual code.

Lastly, another main challenge is just the amount of material there is. It is very deterring to see how much there is to learn. I've been trying to learn as much as possible and remaining patient. This is a challenge that will always be here. I think the most important thing is to keep a good mentality and be patient. Just cause I am overwhelmed by the amount of material doesn't mean that I am going to let it stop me from learning. I know that if I take it one day at a time that I will be developing some strong skills over time! I am very determined right now.

I will post if I discover new ways to conquer these challenges. Ultimately, this is all a learning experience, and I want to absorb as much information as possible!
