Hello, my name is Alex Erling. I've lived all over the place in places such as Las Vegas, Santa Barbara, Lake Tahoe, Dallas, but I currently reside in Austin, Texas. I graduated from SMU in 2017 with degrees in Finance and Economics. After graduating, I decided that I was interested in learning how to code so I joined the Bloc Software Engineering! Some of my interests include tennis, making music, photography, going on hikes, and being outdoors! My goal for this website is to show the world all of the cool things that I am working on and developing.
