Hello, my name is Alex Erling. I've lived in Las Vegas, Santa Barbara, Lake Tahoe, Dallas, and I currently reside in Austin, Texas. I graduated from SMU with degrees in Finance and Economics. However, I decided that I wanted to learn how to code so I joined the Bloc Software Engineering! Some of my interests include tennis, making music, photography, going on hikes, and being outdoors! My goal for this website is to show the world all of the cool things that I am working on and developing.
