Hello, my name is Alex Erling. Welcome to my website! I've lived all over the place in Nevada, California, and Texas but I currently reside in Reno, Nevada I graduated from SMU in 2017 with dual degrees in Finance and Economics. After graduating, I decided I wanted to pursue a career in technology, so I enrolled in the Bloc Software Engineering course. Having finished the course, I am currently looking for a job. I am excited to see where I end up. Some of my interests include tennis, making music, photography, going on hikes, and being outdoors!
